# cid-accumulator

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This project is unaudited and has not been thoroughly tested.

### What it does

- Trustlessly computes and stores an IPFS CID on-chain that represents **all emitted event data**
- Computes the CID incrementally as new data is added
- Allows users to fetch the full dataset from IPFS using a single `getLatestCID()` call

Apps often emit on-chain events that users need later — like Merkle tree commitments, offers, or market data. But querying and reconstructing large event logs is inefficient, especially for users on free-tier RPCs.

This contract solves that by having _the smart contract itself_ compute and store an IPFS CID (using the `dag-cbor` codec) that points to a file containing all data ever emitted. The contract maintains this CID as an accumulator root. A lightweight (and untrusted) off-chain service can watch events and publish the data to IPFS. Users can fetch everything they need directly from IPFS, with full trust in the data’s integrity — because _the smart contract itself_ computed the CID.

### Usage

Have your contract inherit from the `DagCborAccumulator` contract.

```solidity
contract Example is DagCborAccumulator {
    function addData(bytes calldata newData) external {
        _addData(newData);
    }
}
```

You can call `_addData` with any `bytes` payload you'd like to include in the accumulator. This appends the data to the internal Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) and updates the CID.

> ℹ️ Most inserts fall in the 12.8k - 23.5k gas range. See below for more about gas costs.

Use `getLatestCID()` to retrieve the IPFS CID of the file that includes all data added so far.

### ⛽ Gas Costs

The execution gas cost of `_addData` depends on how many **merge steps** are triggered by that particular insert. Most inserts only require a single peak update and are cheap. Occasionally, an insert will trigger a chain of merges — and this is what increases gas (for that insert only).

| Merge Depth | Description                          | Approx Gas     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 0           | No merges (new peak at height 0)     | ~12.8k - 15.5k |
| 1           | Merge with 1 peak (into height 1)    | ~19.5k         |
| 2           | Merge with 2 peaks (into height 2)   | ~23.5k         |
| 3           | Merge with 3 peaks (into height 3)   | ~27.5k         |
| 4           | Merge with 4 peaks (into height 4)   | ~31.5k         |
| 5           | Merge with 5 peaks (into height 5)   | ~35.5k         |
| 6           | Merge with 6 peaks (into height 6)   | ~39.5k         |
| 7           | Merge with 7 peaks (into height 7)   | ~43.5k         |
| 8           | Merge with 8 peaks (into height 8)   | ~47.5k         |
| 9           | Merge with 9 peaks (into height 9)   | ~51k           |
| 10          | Merge with 10 peaks (into height 10) | ~55k           |

> ℹ️ Most inserts fall in the **12.5K–23.5K gas** range. Deeper merges are **exponentially rare**:
>
> - Merge depth 3 happens once every 8 inserts
> - Merge depth 6 happens once every 64 inserts
> - Merge depth 9 happens once every 512 inserts

For example, if you insert `2^20` entries (just over 1 million), here’s how often each merge depth occurs:

| Merge Depth | Inserts (%) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 0           | 50.0%       |
| 1           | 25.0%       |
| 2           | 12.5%       |
| 3           | 6.25%       |
| 4           | 3.125%      |
| 5           | 1.5625%     |
| 6           | 0.78125%    |
| 7           | 0.390625%   |
| 8           | 0.1953125%  |
| 9           | 0.09765625% |

> ✅ Even after a million inserts, over **87%** of them will require **2 or fewer merges**, keeping gas costs low and consistent.

So the gas cost is determined only by that insert’s merge activity — **not** by the total size of the data set.

### 📌 Backend Pinner Service

Anyone can run a pinner service to pin the data emitted by the smart contract. This makes the data (trustlessly) available to front-end clients so they can download it directly from IPFS.

**How to run a pinner service**

1. Install [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop) and start it. You should see "Connected to IPFS" in the UI.

2. Run the pinner service with:
   ```sh
   npx --no-install tsx ./source/pinner/runPinnerService.ts
   ```

**What the service does**

You will be prompted for:
- The address of the smart contract you want to pin data for.
- The URL of the Ethereum RPC provider you want to use. (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, or `https://rpc.ankr.com/...`)
- The URL of the IPFS node you want to use. (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5001`)

(You can optionally set these in the `.env` file with `TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `ETHEREUM_RPC_PROVIDER_URL`, and `IPFS_API_URL`, respectively)

The service will start syncing from wherever it left off (if this is the first time running it, it will create a new local database to store events and sync from the beginning). As it syncs, it pins all relevant data to IPFS and stores the leaf insert events in the local database.

Once it is caught up, it will start listening for new events and pin them as they come in.
